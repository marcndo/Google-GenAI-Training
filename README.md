# GenAI Intensive Training Program - Google & Kaggle
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the 5-day Intensive GenAI Training Program offered by Google and Kaggle. In this repository, you will find all the assignments, exercises, and the capstone project that I completed during the training. This repository serves as a practical demonstration of my learning in the field of Generative AI (GenAI).

## Overview
This training program provides in-depth knowledge of generative AI, focusing on various tools, frameworks, and models that drive the future of artificial intelligence. The course covers foundational topics such as neural networks, transformers, and GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), as well as practical applications like text generation, image creation, and more.

## Training Objectives
Day 1: Introduction to Generative AI, foundational concepts, and neural network architectures.
Day 2: Introduction to embeddings, vector databases, and their use in classifying, comparing, and evaluating textual data in LLM applications.
Day 3: #
Day 4: #
Day 5: Capstone project: Applying learned concepts to a real-world generative AI problem.
Assignments

Throughout the program, I completed several assignments and hands-on coding exercises to deepen my understanding of GenAI concepts. Below is a list of the assignments:

## Assignments

## Capstone Project
For the capstone project, I applied everything I learned throughout the program to solve a real-world problem. The project is based on [Insert Capstone Project Topic].

### Objective:
+ Use generative AI techniques to solve [describe the problem you worked on].
+ The solution leverages models such as transformers, GANs, and reinforcement learning (or any other relevant models).
### Key Components:
+ Data Collection: [Describe the data sources or dataset you used.]
+ Modeling: [Explain the models you built or fine-tuned.]
+ Evaluation: [Describe the metrics or methods you used to evaluate your model.]
### Demo/Results:
+ [Provide a link to any demo or interactive notebook if available.]
+ [Show results or outcomes of the project.]
+ Link to Code
